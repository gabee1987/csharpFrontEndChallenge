  "Time": "The time in which the data point begins.",
  "Summary": "A human-readable summary describing the weather conditions for a given data point.",
  "Icon": "One of a set of icons to provide a visual display of what's happening. This could be one of: clear-day, clear-night, rain, snow, sleet, wind, fog, cloudy, partly-cloudy-day, partly-cloudy-night.",
  "NearestStormDistance": "The approximate distance to the nearest storm in kilometers or miles.",
  "NearestStormBearing": "The approximate direction in degrees in which a storm is travelling with 0° representing true north.",
  "PrecipIntensity": "The rate in which liquid precipitation is falling. This value is expressed in millimeters per hour or inches per hour.",
  "PrecipIntensityError": "The standard deviation of the precipitationIntensity.",
  "PrecipProbability": "The probability of precipitation occurring expressed as a value between 0 and 1 inclusive.",
  "PrecipType": "The type of precipitation occurring. If precipIntensity is greater than zero this property will have one of the following values: rain, snow or sleet otherwise the value will be none. sleet is defined as any precipitation which is neither rain nor snow.",
